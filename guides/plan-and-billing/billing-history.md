# Billing History

Here's the Billing History block:

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-nimbusweb.me-2022.07.04-00\_20\_34.png)

Transactions for the purchase of a user plan or an additional package are displayed in this block.

The block consists of:

* Transaction date;
* Transaction status:\
  &#x20;\- waiting - the first status that is assigned to a transaction after the start of the purchase of a fee or an additional package, that is, when the user opens the payment widget.\
  &#x20;\- active - the status that is assigned to the transaction if the payment was successful.\
  &#x20;\- declined - the status assigned to a transaction if it is no longer relevant. For example, a user created transactions for the purchase of Startup and Standard plans, eventually bought Startup, so transaction for the Standard plan will be assigned this status.
* Transaction price;
* Transaction name.
