You can purchase both monthly and yearly plan. The second image clearly shows how much you can save per month if you buy the annual plan right away.

Plan features:

* Calls per minute - the number of requests that a user can send in one minute. If this limit is exceeded, the API will return an appropriate error.
* Credits on day - number of credits provided per day.
* Credits on month - number of credits provided per month.
* second hash time - shows the delay with which you receive data on the API, for example, the exchange rate for any crypto pair.

The user can re-purchase the plan, thereby updating the expiration date of the plan by clicking on the "Update your plan" button.

After clicking on the buy / update plan button, a payment widget will open for payment in cryptocurrency:
